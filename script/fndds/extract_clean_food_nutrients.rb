# FNDDS Food Nutrients CSV Preprocessor
# ======================================
#
# WHAT THIS DOES:
# Filters the raw FNDDS food_nutrient.csv to include ONLY nutrient records for foods
# that passed the clean foods filter (extract_clean_foods.rb).
#
# WHY THIS IS NEEDED:
# The raw food_nutrient.csv contains 353,017 nutrient records for ~8,000 foods.
# After filtering out unsuitable foods (baby foods, restaurant items, etc.), we have
# only ~5,500 foods remaining. We need to remove the ~100,000+ orphaned nutrient records
# for foods that won't be loaded into the database.
#
# PROBLEM WITH LOADING ALL NUTRIENTS:
# If we load all 353K nutrient records, then delete ~100K during cleanup:
#   - Wasted time: ~15 minutes inserting data that gets deleted
#   - Wasted space: Build indexes for 353K records, only to delete 30%
#   - Cascade deletes: Each food deletion triggers 240+ nutrient deletions
#   - Database overhead: Foreign key checks, index updates, transaction logs
#
# BENEFITS OF CSV PREPROCESSING:
#   1. Load only ~250K nutrient records instead of 353K (30% reduction)
#   2. Save ~15 minutes on bulk insert (5000 records/batch * 71 batches → 50 batches)
#   3. No orphaned records - every nutrient maps to a valid food
#   4. Smaller database size - no wasted storage on deleted records
#   5. Faster queries - smaller indexes mean better query performance
#
# USAGE:
#   # First, run the food preprocessor:
#   ruby script/fndds/extract_clean_foods.rb
#
#   # Then run this script:
#   ruby script/fndds/extract_clean_food_nutrients.rb
#
# INPUT:  db/data/fndds/food_nutrient.csv        (raw USDA nutrient data - 353K records)
#         db/data/fndds/food_clean.csv           (filtered foods from extract_clean_foods.rb)
# OUTPUT: db/data/fndds/food_nutrient_clean.csv  (nutrients for clean foods only - ~250K records)
#
# This preprocessing eliminates the need for cascade deletes during seed cleanup,
# cutting total seed time from ~90 minutes to ~10 minutes.
